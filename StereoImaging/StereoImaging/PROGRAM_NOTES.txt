ERRORS SUCH AS:

System.TypeInitializationException: 'The type initializer for 'Emgu.CV.Util.VectorOfPointF' threw an exception.'

You will need the opencv compiled cpp libraries.

If you have installed the emgu cv examples solutions, they will be placed in a shared libs directory to copy from.

C:\Emgu\emgucv-windesktop 3.4.1.2976\libs\x64

I copy it to the bin directory. For some reason I can't get it to copy to the bin directory from that project.
